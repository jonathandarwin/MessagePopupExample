# MessagePopupExample
## 1. Text Message
This is the simplest way to show the message, can be error message or anything else.
You only need to set text to TextView or show the TextView that already has the text in it.
 
 ## 2. Toast Message
 The text will be floating below our layout.
 To show the toast message, all you need is call the Toast.makeText() when the action is fired.
 You can set the duration of your toast (Toast.LENGTH_SHORT or Toast.LENGTH_LONG)
